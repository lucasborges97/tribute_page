                <h3>Early life:</h3>
                <p>Elon Musk spent his childhood in Pretoria, Transvaal, South Africa. His mother is Maye Musk, a model and dietitian born in Saskatchewan, Canada, but raised in South Africa. His father is Errol Musk, a South African electromechanical engineer, pilot, sailor, consultant, and property developer. At the age of 10, Elon Musk developed an interest in computing. He learned computer programming using a manual and, by age 12. He sold the code of a BASIC-based video game he created called Blastar to PC and Office Technology magazine for approximately $500.</p>

                <h3>Education:</h3>
                <p>He graduated in 1997 with a Bachelor of Science (BS) degree in economics from the Wharton School and a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in physics. In 1994, Musk held two internships in Silicon Valley during the summer: at an energy storage start-up called Pinnacle Research Institute, which researched electrolytic ultracapacitors for energy storage, and at the Palo Alto-based start-up Rocket Science Games.[43] Bruce Leak, the former lead engineer behind Apple's QuickTime who had hired Musk, noted: "He had boundless energy. Kids these days have no idea about hardware or how stuff works, but he had a PC hacker background and was not afraid to just go figure things out." In 1995, Musk was accepted to a Ph.D. program in energy physics/materials science at Stanford University in California.</p>

                <h3>Inventions:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Tesla Motors, electric car. These days, it’s impossible not to think of Musk without quickly thinking of Tesla, the publicly traded electric-car company whose stock has increased nearly 700 percent in the last 2.5 years to just under $213 a share at press time. Despite reporting third-quarter results that missed Wall Street expectations, the company boasts revenues of $1.24 billion and claims strong guidance for future deliveries.</li>
                    <li>SpaceX, Falcon rocket. Musk’s aerospace company may be just as famous as his automobiles. Founded in 2002 to help reduce the cost of space transportation and enable the colonization of Mars, SpaceX’s Falcon 1 and Falcon 9 rockets are designed to be reusable. The company has flown six cargo resupply missions to the International Space Station and has been awarded a contract by NASA to develop a spacecraft to take crew members to and from the ISS.</li>
                    <li>X.com (PayPal) e-payments. In 1999, Musk co-founded a company called X.com, which focused on financial services and email payments. A year later, X.com merged with Confinity and adopted the name of that company’s best-known service, PayPal. The two technologies created a powerhouse that led the way in online payments, which was eventually bought by eBay in 2002 for $1.5 billion. Musk pocketed $165 million from that deal.</li>
                    <li>Hyperloop. Musk’s latest idea might be his most ambitious. This transportation system, introduced in 2013 and still in the formulative stages, aims to allow commuters to travel between Los Angeles and San Francisco in 35 minutes or less — faster than a commercial flight.</li>
                    <li>Zip2, online city guides. Musk’s first Web software company, founded with his brother using money loaned by their father, was aimed toward helping the newspaper industry put together ‘city guides’ for online users. After considering, and ultimately rejecting, a merger with CitySearch (IACI), Zip2 was bought by Compaq for $307 million in 1999. Musk received $22 million from the sale.</li>
                    <li>SolarCity, solar-power systems. Co-founded in 2006 by Musk and his cousins, SolarCity has since grown to become the second-largest provider of solar-power systems in the country, with revenues of $102.8 million in the most recent quarter. While it’s centered in California, it also provides installations in select areas of 14 other states (and the District of Columbia).</li>
                    <li>Electric Jet. Musk hasn’t officially started working on this project, but last year at MIT’s Aeronautics and Astronautics Centennial Symposium, he said he was “toying” with the concept. Musk also has mused on The Colbert Report about the opportunity to have a “vertical takeoff and landing electric supersonic jet,” which uses electric motors to drive a fan, which in turn propels the aircraft. It would not require a long runway, so airports could be smaller.</li>
                    <li>Web-based phone calls. Back in 1997, Musk had an idea about allowing computers to call land lines (something he secured a patent for in 2001). The idea was a bit less intricate than what we use today with Skype, though. Instead, the idea went, users could click on a company’s contact information online and then calls would be routed to the company via a call center.</li>
                    <li>Location-specific searches. In the early days of the Internet, finding a business that was close to you wasn’t the priority it is today. Musk, in 1998, thought it might be someday, though. His idea was to create a system that initially searched for results in the geographic area closest to you, then automatically widening that area (meaning the user wouldn’t have to refine the search) until there were enough results.</li>
                </ul>
